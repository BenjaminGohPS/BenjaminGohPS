Greetings! My name is Benjamin Goh. Join me as I embark on my journey to be a full stack developer! Starting with enrolling myself in General Assembly Software Engineer Bootcamp (SEB)! Let's connect too! [Linkedin](https://github.com/BenjaminGohPS)

It has been a few weeks of coding, as you can tell from the number of new repository created. There are 4 projects due in this course, and I have just completed the:-

- 1st project (1/4); created a browser based game. It's already launched, so you may give it a try [here](https://benjamingohps.github.io/benben-adventure/). Leave a comment if you had fun, and enjoyed it! Thank you!
- 2nd project (2/4); [F1 Driver App](https://github.com/BenjaminGohPS/F1-drivers-app). Had lots of fun with this! Created this for my group of friends to use when we are out chatting and discussing F1 stuff! Awaiting to deploy
- 3rd project (3/4); [Wander Go Where](https://github.com/everett-wxy/WanderGoWhereFrontEnd). A personalise trip planner with budgeting aspect. It's in beta stage, and I can't wait to share this with you!
- 4th project (4/4); [MATS App](https://github.com/BenjaminGohPS/MATS-app-frontend). My final project. Full-stack app. I think this app has immmense potential, and it's a very useful app for individuals, and a great tool for healthcare organisation. App still in beta atage.
