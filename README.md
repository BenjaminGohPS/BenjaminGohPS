## About me ðŸ˜„

<!-- add more items to the table, and do up a nicer about me page -->

Greetings! My name is Benjamin Goh. Join me as I embark on my journey to be a full stack developer! Starting with enrolling myself in General Assembly Software Engineer Bootcamp (SEB)!
It has been a few weeks of coding, as you can tell from the number of new repository created. There are 4 projects due in this course, and I have just completed the 1st project (1/4); created a browser based game. It's already launched, so you may give it a try. Leave a comment if you had fun, and enjoyed it! Thank you!
